AdWords API PHP4 client library
===============================

Provides access to the Google AdWords API v2009 in PHP4.

This library abstracts a lot of the AdWords API complexity away. Thus, it is
quick and easy to use for simple API tasks. More involved operations, however,
are likely to be unimplemented.

For the moment, this library is focussed on managing ad group criteria.

Tested on Debian Etch with libapache2-mod-php4 version 4.4.4-8+etch6 and
NuSOAP 0.7.3.
